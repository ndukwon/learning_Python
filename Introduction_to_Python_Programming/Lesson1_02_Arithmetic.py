Guideline
- When you call a function like print, put the opening parenthesis straight after the name of the function like in print(8).
- Donâ€™t put extra spaces inside the parentheses either, it should be print(3*7).
- If you are mixing operators with different priorities (like multiplication and subtraction),
  then you might like to add a space around the lower priority (in this case addition and subtraction) operator
  in order to make the code easier to read. For example, 1 + 2*3.
- Don't write extremely long lines of code; they're hard to understand.
  People commonly limit themselves to lines that are 79 or 99 characters long.
  If you feel that you need to write longer lines, consider rewriting and simplifying your code.

# Quiz: Calculate And Format
'''
In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler.
Two parts of a floor need tiling.
One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long,
the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long.
Tiles come in packages of 6.
How many tiles are needed?
You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many tiles will be left over?
Remember to following the formatting guidelines above as you write your code.
'''
# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print('Calculate And Format 1:', 9*7 + 5*7)

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print('Calculate And Format 2:', 17*6 - (9*7 + 5*7))


print('0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 =', 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1)
print('0.3 =', 0.3)
